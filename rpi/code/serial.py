# Read acceleration data from ADXL345

# each and hold the output data for each axis. Register 0x32 and
# Register 0x33 hold the output data for the x-axis, Register 0x34 and
# Register 0x35 hold the output data for the y-axis, and Register 0x36
# and Register 0x37 hold the output data for the z-axis. The output
# data is twos complement, with DATAx0 as the least significant byte
# and DATAx1 as the most significant byte, where x represent X,
# Y, or Z. The DATA_FORMAT register (Address 0x31) controls the
# format of the data. It is recommended that a multiple-byte read of all
# registers be performed to prevent a change in data between reads
# of sequential registers.
